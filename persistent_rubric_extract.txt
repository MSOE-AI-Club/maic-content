Project List Friendly reminder that all groups will have access to Persistent partners to ask questions throughout the competition. If you see a project but want more data, context, and even brainstorming help, just ask! ( Fill out the project interest form to receive a Persistent mentor &amp; Databricks access ) Groups are allowed to tackle multiple Project Ideas , but we recommend focusing on one Project Idea. Project Idea: AI-Powered Crime Risk Intelligence &amp; Decision Support Insurers rely on accurate crime-risk insights to price and underwrite location-based policies, but crime data is often fragmented, inconsistent, and difficult for non-experts to interpret. Even when crime indexes exist (person vs. property crimes), organizations struggle to translate raw statistics into clear, defensible decisions. A decision-support system that interprets crime patterns and projects future risk could improve pricing fairness, reduce losses, and help other stakeholders—like real estate teams and urban planners—understand safety trade-offs. Suggested Approach &amp; Deliverables: Prepare and explore crime index data; document assumptions, geography granularity, and data quality gaps. Build baseline risk scoring models by region (classification or forecasting ) and compare approaches (simple index rules vs. ML). Add trend detection and scenario-style “what changes risk” analysis (e.g., shifting crime mix, regional changes over time). Produce an evaluation report with practical guidance (what confidence levels mean, where predictions fail, and how to use outputs). Deliver a simple dashboard/report view: “Risk by geography” map/table Risk drivers (person vs. property composition) Pricing/decision guidance examples for key personas (insurer, real estate, urban planning) Dataset : Crime Intelligence Project Idea: AI-Powered Investment Advisor Retail investors face an overwhelming stream of financial signals—price movement, volatility, volume, earnings, and risk metrics—without a clear way to turn them into actionable decisions. While platforms offer raw data, investors still ask: “What does this mean for me?” Comparing many companies across sectors (e.g., Telecom, Retail) and reconciling conflicting indicators is especially hard for beginners with limited time and expertise. A responsible investment advisor could summarize company health, flag risk, and explain trade-offs in plain language. Suggested Approach &amp; Deliverables: Prepare and explore financial/company feature data; handle missingness, scaling, and leakage risks Build supervised baselines for recommendation labels (Buy/Hold/Avoid) or a risk-score approach; justify your labeling strategy. Compare models and provide guardrails (confidence thresholds, “abstain” option, calibration). Deliver an evaluation report focused on decision usefulness (not just accuracy): stability over time, risk sensitivity, error patterns. Provide a simple “advisor” interface: Company summary + risk score Explanation of key drivers (interpretable contributions) Side-by-side comparison view (two companies or a shortlist) Dataset : Yahoo Finance Business Dataset Project Idea: Population Health Management Intelligence Health systems and public-health teams need reliable population-level insights to plan screening programs, treatment capacity, and prevention strategies—but data is often complex, fragmented, and hard to operationalize. Without clear visibility into disease prevalence and geographic distribution, planners can’t proactively allocate resources or anticipate emerging burdens. A population health intelligence system could turn EHR-level signals into geographic trend insights and scenario-based planning recommendations. Suggested Approach &amp; Deliverables: Prepare and explore EHR-derived population features; define cohorts, geography levels, and data-quality assumptions. Build models to track prevalence and trends (forecasting, clustering, risk stratification, or hotspot detection). Provide geographic pattern outputs (maps/tables) and scenario planning (e.g., “if prevalence rises X% in region Y…”). Produce an evaluation report highlighting reliability, bias risks, and operational guidance for planning teams. Deliver a “planning view” that supports: Burden by region/cohort Trend projections Resource planning recommendations and uncertainties Dataset : Cardiology EHR Project Idea: Nonprofit Executive Compensation Integrity Analyzer Nonprofits disclose finances, governance, and executive compensation via IRS Form 990 filings, but donors, regulators, and watchdogs often struggle to interpret this information or spot anomalies. When compensation appears misaligned with an organization’s scale, revenues, or mission, stakeholders need a defensible way to identify red flags, compare peers, and generate clear explanations. An integrity analyzer could improve transparency, help responsible donors, and support governance accountability. Suggested Approach &amp; Deliverables: Prepare and explore IRS 990 structured fields; define “peer groups” (similar org type, size, region) and document methodology. Build baseline anomaly detection / outlier scoring for compensation vs. org capacity (revenue, expenses, staff scale proxies). Add governance risk signals (w ` available): missing policies, unusual structures, inconsistencies across fields/years. Produce an evaluation report describing scoring logic, false-positive controls, and limitations (data gaps, legitimate edge cases). Generate a human-readable audit report per organization: Compensation reasonableness score Peer comparisons Detected red flags + evidence Clear “what to review next” recommendations Dataset : IRS 990 Tax-Exempt Organizations Annual Filing Project Idea: Clinical Coding Assistant Payers and providers depend on accurate clinical coding for claims processing, denial prevention, and timely reimbursement. But clinical notes are unstructured, jargon-heavy, and inconsistently documented—making manual coding slow, expensive, and error-prone. The challenge isn’t just extraction; it’s producing audit-ready ICD-10 and NDC mappings with transparency and confidence controls. An AI-powered coding assistant could accelerate coding while improving consistency and compliance. Suggested Approach &amp; Deliverables: Prepare and explore clinical text; define preprocessing and PHI-safe handling assumptions (as applicable). Use NLP to extract diagnoses, procedures, and medications (e.g., via John Snow Labs), then map entities to ICD-10 and NDC. Build confidence scoring and fallback logic (“needs human review”) to manage uncertainty and reduce risky auto-codes. Deliver an evaluation report: Precision/recall of code assignment (overall + by code category) Common failure modes (negation, temporality, abbreviations) Auditability and compliance considerations Provide a demo workflow: Input note ? extracted entities ? recommended codes + evidence spans ? reviewer override Dataset : ICD-10 CM and CPT coded data Databricks Deployment: All these projects can be deployed and scaled on Databricks, giving you a powerful platform for experimentation, collaboration, and production-level AI workflows. Persistent provides Databricks credits to participating teams so you can get started without worrying about infrastructure costs. To claim your credits, you’ll receive instructions from your Persistent mentor . We’ve also prepared a step-by-step tutoria ls to help you spin up your environment, connect data, and run your models smoothly. Your Team : Each team will have a mentor providing guidance to 8-12 team members. While not required to have 8 members on a team, 12 members is the maximum allowed capacity. The following guidelines are used by AI-Club to build each team: Team Composition : Teams will consist of people from a variety of skill levels. Each team is built to have a good balance of beginners and advanced members, given AI-Club aids with the team composition . Team Synergy : Teams will be formed based on shared interests, bringing together motivated and like-minded group members who can inspire and support each other throughout the project. Mentor Guidelines : Mentors will provide guidance and direction for the 8-12 members of the Innovation Lab team. This includes setting up weekly meetings and have an agenda created for each to ensure project direction stays consistent. We also encourage mentors to share relevant learning resources from our Learning Tree . Advice From Previous Mentors 4. Event Prizes! 1st Place: $ 4 000 (+ 15 pts) 2nd Place: $ 3 000 (+ 1 0 pts) 3rd Place: $ 1 000 (+ 5 pts) Unique Unicorn : $ 5 00 (+5 pts) Best Deployment : $ 5 00 (+5 pts) (All groups participating will get +10 pts &amp; LinkedIn Certificate ) 5. Judging Rubric Your solution will be judged based on how effectively it addresses the problem, the confidence it provides in solving that problem, and how well it fits into the broader industry context. While technical execution is important, solutions will be evaluated more on their current effectiveness and future growth potential rather than sheer complexity. 1. Problem Understanding &amp; Approach (30%) Does the team clearly define the problem they are solving? Is the solution directly relevant to the problem? Does the approach demonstrate innovative thinking? 2. Effectiveness &amp; Accuracy (20%) How well does the solution perform in solving the intended problem? Is there evidence (tests, demos, benchmarks) to support its reliability? 3. Industry Fit &amp; Practicality (40%) Is this something Persistent and their partners could realistically use? How well does the solution align with existing workflows or industry needs? Novel vs. Known Approaches: Both have distinct advantages and drawbacks. Teams must clearly demonstrate their chosen approach’s effectiveness and benefits relative to the alternative. 4. Scalability (10%) How well can the solution be transferred to the sponsor or end users for continued use and maintenance? How easily can the solution be deployed at scale ? Does the solution effectively leverage enterprise-grade platforms for scalability, maintainability, and performance? Ex: Using Genie &amp; Lakebase is the teams favorite! While groups will be using cloud platforms like Databricks, Scalability is only 10% of the rubric, so it is also important to focus on your solutions capabilities as well. Total possible score: 100% First, second, and third place will be judged based on the criteria outlined above. However, we want to award any significant effort put into accomplishing a goal! Any of the above challenges may be impossible or far more difficult than initially anticipated. This is the reality of business problems - Uncertainty is the only thing which is certain after all! Teams may find road bumps throughout their course that can ultimately lead to what may seem like failure. At Persistent , we don’t believe that any form of discovery is failure, even if that discovery is that a problem is unsolvable! 6.
