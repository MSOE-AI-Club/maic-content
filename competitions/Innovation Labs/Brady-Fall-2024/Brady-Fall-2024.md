## The Challenge: Getting Creative with Liquids
The theme for 2024, **“Getting Creative with Liquids,”** focuses on solving critical industry problems related to liquid measurement and analysis. Participants are tasked with designing AI-based solutions to predict liquid levels in containers using images. Additionally, teams are encouraged to explore attributes like liquid color, container dimensions, and other innovative applications that expand the problem's scope.

To help students get started, AI-Club has developed a baseline solution using the YOLOv8 segmentation algorithm. Teams build upon this foundation, innovating to create scalable, accurate, and versatile solutions that meet a range of industry needs, including sustainability, safety, and operational efficiency.
