**Innovation Labs Spring 2025**, hosted by the MSOE Artificial Intelligence Club (MAIC) in collaboration with Juno (formerly TruePrep.ai), gave students the chance to tackle pressing fintech problems while honing their AI expertise.

## The Challenge: Modernizing Tax Accounting
Tax accounting is filled with repetitive, time‑consuming tasks, but AI can change that. Juno challenged participants to design AI‑powered tools that streamline everything from data entry to in‑depth tax reviews, empowering accountants to work faster and with greater confidence. Example project tracks included:

- **Tax Deep Research Agent** – combine LLM research agents with dummy tax returns to surface missed credits and law changes.

- **Virtual Dave** – build a content‑creating digital twin of Juno's founder, Dave Haase, that drafts blogs, scripts, and social posts.

- **Tax Review Agent** – automatically cross‑check returns, source documents, and prior‑year data, flagging discrepancies and new opportunities.

- **Choose Your Own Adventure** – propose any novel fintech solution aligned with Juno's mission of helping accountants work smarter.

## Exciting Developments from Innovation Labs

One of the standout successes of this collaboration is the recent rebranding of TruePrep to Juno, marking a significant milestone for the company. Notably, through their involvement with Innovation Labs, Juno developed and released a new product, the Tax Reviewer, which was directly supported by an intern hired from this very program. This outcome showcases the tangible benefits of the Innovation Labs in fostering direct industry impact, highlighting how MAIC effectively bridges students with real-world opportunities.
