## HacksGiving 2024: AI for Good with Discovery World

HacksGiving 2024 was a tremendous success! From November 21–24, the MSOE Artificial Intelligence Club (MAIC), in collaboration with Discovery World, hosted its second annual **HacksGiving: AI for Good** hackathon. Over the course of three days, more than 70 students from across MSOE and beyond came together to design cutting-edge AI solutions to enhance visitor interactions at Milwaukee’s premier science and technology museum.

### The Challenge: AI for Discovery World
This year’s challenge invited participants to develop AI-driven solutions that would make Discovery World’s exhibits more immersive, accessible, and engaging for visitors of all ages. Teams were tasked with addressing key considerations such as personalization, language accessibility, scalability, and educational value. The goal? To create solutions that could enrich the experience for everyone, from curious five-year-olds to seasoned experts.

### Event Highlights
HacksGiving kicked off on Thursday evening with an inspiring keynote from Dr. Jeremy Kedziora and Discovery World’s UX designer Evan Jackson. Students were introduced to the problem statement, encouraged to form teams, and provided with resources to begin brainstorming their ideas.

The following days were filled with energy and collaboration as teams worked tirelessly in Diercks Hall to bring their visions to life. With access to cutting-edge tools, mentorship from AI experts, and plenty of snacks to fuel their creativity, participants made impressive progress on their projects.

On Sunday, teams presented their final solutions to a panel of judges, including Discovery World staff, MSOE faculty, and AI-Club mentors. The innovative ideas and high-quality presentations left the judges in awe.
