    "summary": "By reading this article, you'll learn what Conditional GANs (cGANs) are and how they extend standard GANs by incorporating extra information to control their outputs. We’ll explain how cGANs work (in a friendly, intuitive way) and explore real-world applications like image-to-image translation, super-resolution, and text-to-image synthesis. Along the way, we’ll compare cGANs to regular GANs – discussing use cases, advantages, and disadvantages – so you understand when and why to use a conditional GAN. By the end, you’ll also know where you can try out a cGAN yourself through an online demo or open-source code.",
