    "summary": "By reading this article, you'll learn what Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are and how they work in a simple, beginner-friendly way. We'll break down their architecture with helpful visuals and analogies, and show how they’re used in real-world applications like image generation, anomaly detection, and data restoration. Whether you're curious about how machines can invent new content or want to explore AI-powered creativity and diagnostics, this guide will give you a strong foundation. We'll also link you to hands-on demos so you can try out VAEs for yourself—even if you're just getting started in machine learning.",
