    "summary": "By reading this article, you'll learn the basics of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) – including what they are, how they work, and some of their coolest applications. We'll avoid complex math or code, using simple analogies and real-world examples (like AI-created art and deepfake videos) to make these concepts easy to grasp. By the end, you'll also know where you can try out a GAN yourself through an interactive online demo.",
