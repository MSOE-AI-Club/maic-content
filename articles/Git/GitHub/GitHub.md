Learn the basics of Git and GitHub including what they are, how they work together, and why they are essential tools for managing and collaborating on code.

## Why Read?
GitHub is a platform used by over 100 million developers to build, scale, and deliver secure software. Learning the fundamentals of GitHub allows you to:
- Showcase and share your work
- Track and manage changes to your code
- Allow others to review your code
- Collaborate on projects without worrying about the impact your work may have on your collaborators

Learning Git and GitHub will significantly increase ones efficiency and productivity. Additionally, learning Git will also be a crucial tool for anyone hoping to work in a professional programming environment.

## What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It helps you track changes to your codebase over time. This is especially useful when:
- You want to go back to a previous version of your code
- You need to experiment with new features in isolated branches
- Multiple developers are working on the same project simultaneously

Git stores the entire history of your project, including who changed what, when, and why. You can use commands like git commit, git branch, and git merge to manage your work locally, and push it to a shared repository for collaboration.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store Git repositories and collaborate with others. It adds features like pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking, making teamwork smoother. It also acts as a portfolio, showing off your coding skills to potential employers or collaborators.

## How do Git and GitHub Work Together?
You use Git to manage changes locally and GitHub to back up and share your work. You push code to GitHub, others pull it, and everyone can suggest or review changes through pull requests. This workflow keeps projects organized and makes collaboration simple and safe.

## Conclusion
Git and GitHub are powerful tools that make coding more organized, collaborative, and reliable. By learning how to track changes, manage versions, and work with others using GitHub, you'll not only improve your workflow but also gain skills that are highly valued in the software development industry. Whether youâ€™re building your first project or contributing to open-source software, mastering Git and GitHub is a key step in becoming a confident and capable developer.
