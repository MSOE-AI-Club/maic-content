Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a subfield of reinforcement learning that focuses on using deep neural networks to approximate the value functions or policies of RL agents. This approach has been highly successful in solving complex problems, and is essential for building advanced RL agents that can handle high-dimensional state and action spaces.
