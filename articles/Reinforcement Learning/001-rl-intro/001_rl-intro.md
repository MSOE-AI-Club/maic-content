Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment. This is particularly useful in domains where the agent must learn to make sequential decisions, such as playing games or controlling robots. This subfield of machine learning has seen rapid growth in recent years, with many exciting applications in areas such as robotics, finance, and healthcare.

## What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with its environment to achieve goals. Unlike supervised learning, where models learn from labeled data, RL agents learn from trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on their actions.

At its core, RL involves:

* **Agent** — makes decisions
* **Environment** — the world the agent interacts with
* **State** — what the agent observes
* **Action** — what the agent chooses to do
* **Reward** — the feedback that guides learning
* **Policy** — strategy for choosing actions
