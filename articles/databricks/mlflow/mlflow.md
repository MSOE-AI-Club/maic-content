# A Beginner's Guide to MLflow in Databricks

Managing machine learning projects can quickly get chaotic: scripts multiply, model versions become unclear, and results are hard to reproduce. **MLflow** solves these problems. Inside **Databricks**, MLflow becomes a managed, seamless part of your daily workflow—no setup overhead, just productive experimentation.

---

## What is MLflow?

MLflow is an open-source MLOps framework for managing the end-to-end ML lifecycle: experiment tracking, reproducible packaging, model versioning, and deployment. It's framework-agnostic (works with scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, LightGBM, and more) and supports multiple languages (Python, R, Java, REST).

**Core Benefits at a Glance:**

- Track every run (parameters, metrics, artifacts) automatically
- Register, version, and govern models centrally
- Serve models as REST endpoints with minimal effort
- Reproduce & compare experiments reliably
- Collaborate with teammates using a shared UI and registry

---

## Why Use MLflow (Especially in Databricks)?

Without tooling, ML work is fragile and hard to scale. MLflow gives you structure:

| Challenge                   | How MLflow Helps                                         |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Losing track of experiments | Central UI with metrics, params, code version, artifacts |
| Ambiguous model versions    | Model Registry with version numbers & stages             |
| Hard to reproduce           | Logged environments + artifacts + code refs              |
| Deployment friction         | One-click serving or simple API-based deployment         |
| Team collaboration gaps     | Shared registry, tags, descriptions, access control      |

**Tip:** Start logging from day one—even for “quick tests”. Habits formed early pay off massively later.

## MLflow Core Components in Databricks

### 1. Tracking

Log runs using the MLflow API. View them in the Experiments sidebar or the MLflow UI. Compare metrics visually across runs.

### 2. Model Registry

A central system-of-record for models: store, version, annotate, transition stages (None → Staging → Production → Archived), and attach descriptions or approval notes.

### 3. Model Serving & Monitoring

Deploy a registered model to a scalable REST endpoint. Databricks handles infra, scaling, logging, and access control.

### 4. Artifacts Store

Stores model binaries, plots, feature importance files, requirements, or custom outputs from each run.

### 5. Feature & Data Integration

Pair MLflow with Delta Lake and (optionally) the Databricks Feature Store for reproducible feature pipelines.

---

## Beginner Workflow: MLflow in Action

### 1. Create / Attach a Cluster (Runtime ML preferred)

Choose a Databricks Runtime ML cluster so MLflow + common frameworks are pre-installed.

### 2. Start Tracking Experiments

```python
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load data
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

with mlflow.start_run():
    n_estimators = 120
    max_depth = 5

    clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=n_estimators, max_depth=max_depth, random_state=42)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    preds = clf.predict(X_test)
    acc = accuracy_score(y_test, preds)

    # Log parameters & metrics
    mlflow.log_param("n_estimators", n_estimators)
    mlflow.log_param("max_depth", max_depth)
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", acc)

    # Log model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(clf, artifact_path="model")

    print(f"Logged run with accuracy: {acc:.4f}")
```

### 3. Register the Best Model

From the UI select a run → Register Model, or programmatically:

```python
result = mlflow.register_model(
    "runs:/<RUN_ID>/model",  # replace with actual run id
    "IrisRandomForest"
)
```

### 4. Transition Stages

In the Model Registry UI set Stage = Staging (for evaluation) → Production (when approved). Add notes or links to evaluation reports.

### 5. Serve the Model

Open the model in the registry → Enable Serving. Databricks spins up an endpoint. You can call it with JSON payloads.

### 6. Make Predictions via REST (Example)

```python
import requests, json
import pandas as pd

# Example feature vector(s)
features = [[5.9, 3.0, 5.1, 1.8]]

resp = requests.post(
    "https://<workspace-host>/model/IrisRandomForest/1/invocations",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer <DATABRICKS_TOKEN>", "Content-Type": "application/json"},
    data=json.dumps({"dataframe_split": {"columns": ["f1","f2","f3","f4"], "data": features}})
)
print(resp.json())
```

### 7. Iterate & Compare

Use the Runs comparison view to identify which hyperparameters improved performance. Clone notebooks for variant experiments.

---

## Common Logging Patterns

### Log Extra Artifacts (e.g., confusion matrix)

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay

with mlflow.start_run():
    # ... train model ...
    ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(y_test, preds)
    plt.savefig("cm.png")
    mlflow.log_artifact("cm.png")
```

### Log a Custom Environment

```python
mlflow.log_text("pandas==2.2.0\nscikit-learn==1.4.0", "requirements.txt")
```

### Autologging (Quick Start)

```python
mlflow.sklearn.autolog()
```

## Best Practices for Beginners

| Practice                             | Why It Matters                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Log EVERYTHING                       | Missing metrics = lost insight; consistency builds discipline |
| Use meaningful run names             | Makes filtering easier later (e.g., rf_depth5_lr0_01)         |
| Record dataset version               | Use Delta Lake version or commit hash in a tag                |
| Promote via stages                   | Ensures controlled rollout and rollback                       |
| Add model descriptions               | Communicates intent & evaluation criteria                     |
| Tag runs (e.g., experiment=baseline) | Enables grouped analysis                                      |
| Store evaluation plots               | Visual diagnostics accelerate learning                        |

**Tip:** Use `mlflow.set_experiment("<project-name>")` to organize work per project.

---

## Troubleshooting Quick Wins

| Issue                | Fix                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Run not visible      | Confirm correct experiment path / experiment name           |
| Missing metrics      | Ensure `with mlflow.start_run():` wraps the logging code    |
| Model fails to serve | Check that the run logged a supported model flavor          |
| 401 calling endpoint | Token expired or missing Authorization header               |
| Wrong model version  | Explicitly reference version or stage in deployment scripts |

## Summary

MLflow (inside Databricks) gives you structure: every experiment is logged, every model is versioned, and deployment is streamlined. Mastering these fundamentals early greatly improves the quality and credibility of your machine learning work.

**Next Steps:**

1. Create a new experiment and log 3–5 model variants
2. Register the best model and add a description
3. Enable serving and test the REST endpoint
4. Practice staging → production transitions

With these habits, you'll build professional-grade ML workflows from day one.
