summary: Our research group is focused on leveraging DinoV2 vision transformers for medical imaging tasks. Specifically, we aim to align histology images with MRI scans using datasets from the Medical College of Wisconsin. By pretraining DinoV2 on multimodal medical imaging data, we seek to demonstrate that it can achieve the same level of performance as the homologous point transformer (HPT) with significantly less training data. This project highlights the potential of vision transformers as foundational models for medical imaging, enabling more efficient and scalable AI applications in healthcare.
