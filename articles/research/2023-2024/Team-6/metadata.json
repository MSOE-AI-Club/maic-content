    "summary": "Our group delves into the implementation of the card game Hearts using reinforcement learning techniques to investigate the effectiveness of various reinforcement learning algorithms in understanding and strategically playing the game. Using algorithms such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we aim to discern the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches in tackling the complexities of Hearts, thereby providing valuable insights into the advancement of AI systems for game playing.",
