    "summary": "Our research group investigates the potential of using electroencephalogram (EEG) data to classify visual stimuli and map brainwave patterns to images. EEG is typically used for measuring electrical activity in the brain, but we are exploring its application in decoding visual perception. By leveraging labeled EEG-to-Image datasets, we have analyzed signal quality and extracted signal-based features for classification. Our initial machine learning models provide baseline metrics, and we are progressing toward temporal deep learning models to improve classification accuracy and feature mapping.",
