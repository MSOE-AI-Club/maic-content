    "summary": "Our research group, Crew.ai, is focused on developing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play The Crew, a cooperative, hidden information card game. We have built a custom game environment to train and test RL algorithms. Currently, we are implementing two approaches: a heuristic solver for optimal decision-making and a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based solver that uses neural networks to approximate value functions. Future work includes imitation learning, training agents with imperfect information, and multi-agent collaboration.",
