    "summary": "Our research group is developing an AI model that relies on data collected from MSOE students. Due to the sensitive nature of the data, our work requires approval from MSOE's Institutional Review Board (IRB). The first half of the year has been dedicated to writing, submitting, and revising IRB documents, which has slowed progress. However, we have completed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sample datasets and developed initial code for processing data once approval is granted. Our next steps include obtaining IRB approval, conducting the study, training our model, and preparing research papers and presentations.",
