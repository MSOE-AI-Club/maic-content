Our research group is collaborating with The Nilus Project to develop AI-driven environmental modeling techniques for optimizing glacier growth and water conservation. We are formalizing data infrastructure and building AI models to enhance Nilus’ location, operational, and impact models. By leveraging deep learning, remote sensing data, and predictive analytics, we aim to improve ice stupa placement, optimize water usage for glacier formation, and assess environmental impact. This research will utilize MSOE’s ROSIE Supercomputer and focus on developing a scalable framework for AI-driven climate resilience solutions.
