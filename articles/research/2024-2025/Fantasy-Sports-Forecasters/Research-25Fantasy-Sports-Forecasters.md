Our research group is working on predictive modeling for fantasy sports, aiming to improve fantasy point predictions using machine learning techniques. Initially, we developed a simple regression model to estimate fantasy points. Moving forward, we plan to enhance the model by incorporating weather data and opponent statistics to refine its accuracy. By leveraging additional contextual data, we hope to create a more robust and insightful fantasy sports prediction system.
