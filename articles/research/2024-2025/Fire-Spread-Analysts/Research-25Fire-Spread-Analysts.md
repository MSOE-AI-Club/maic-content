Our research group is developing a fire spread prediction model using AI to enhance wildfire forecasting. Initially part of the Innovation Labs, we transitioned to fire spread research after acquiring relevant data on ROSIE. Our goal is to refine the model's accuracy and document our improvements in a research paper. While the work may not introduce entirely novel techniques, it provides valuable experience in AI research and real-world predictive modeling.
