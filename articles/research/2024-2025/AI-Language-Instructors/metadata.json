    "summary": "Our research group is exploring how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to enhance foreign language learning. Traditional methods can become tedious, but we aim to create an engaging and efficient learning experience by integrating AI-driven features. Our system incorporates vocabulary tracking, controlled LLM vocabulary restriction, and AI-generated images for word prompting. With our MVP nearly complete, we are preparing for initial testing and iterative improvements to refine the learning experience.",
