    "summary": "Our research group is investigating the performance of various reinforcement learning techniques on VEX AI Competitive Robotics. With a new game introduced each year, there is no well-established optimal strategy, providing a unique challenge for AI-driven decision-making. We aim to develop RL models that adapt to the dynamic game environment, optimizing robotic performance through iterative learning and strategic planning.",
