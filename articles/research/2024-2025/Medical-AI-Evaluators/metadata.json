    "summary": "Our research group is working on reimplementing the methods from a foundational medical AI paper to replicate and evaluate its results. We have thoroughly analyzed the base paper and identified key implementation steps. Additionally, we have encountered the need for IRB approval to use our selected dataset and are currently in the process of obtaining approval. Once approved, we will focus on model evaluation using ROC curves to validate our replication efforts.",
