    "summary": "Our research group functions as an independent study designed to develop strong foundational skills in machine learning engineering. Over the first semester, we covered a broad spectrum of ML topics, from basic neurons to advanced transformer architectures. Now, students are applying their knowledge to independent projects, including a Text-to-Sequel model and a recommendation system leveraging the Spotify API. The goal is to ensure participants gain hands-on experience and a solid understanding of ML workflows.",
