Our research group explores the application of computer vision techniques in soccer analytics. We have focused on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process game footage and extract insights. Despite scheduling challenges due to the soccer season, we have successfully worked with pretrained models on initial datasets and have expanded the project into independent studies. One study focuses on player instance segmentation, while another tackles geometric projection of the video feed onto a 2D grid.
