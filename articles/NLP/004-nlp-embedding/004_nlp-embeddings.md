<p style='color: white; margin-top: 2px;'>Unlike Bag of Words, which treats words as isolated entities, embeddings represent words, phrases, or even entire documents in a continuous vector space. Learning about embeddings such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and transformer-based embeddings (like BERT) helps you understand how AI captures word meanings, relationships, and context. Embeddings are fundamental in modern AI applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and large language models.

## **Weaviate Blog – Embeddings Visualized**
This article is the most important here since it introduces the concept of embeddings visually, which will help you to gain a fundamental understanding of how embeddings are used.  Specifically, the article introduces vector (embedding) databases, which are designed specifically to store and query high-dimensional vectors (used to represent complex data like text). It explains the core concept of vector storage and retrieval, highlighting the importance of vector databases in modern AI applications. If you're interested in understanding how vector-based data is stored and managed for tasks like semantic search and recommendation systems, this article will give you a solid foundation.
