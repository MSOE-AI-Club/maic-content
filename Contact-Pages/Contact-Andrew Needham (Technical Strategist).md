### Workshop Developer Strategist

Hi! My name is Andrew Needham, and I am a Sophomore Computer Science student at MSOE. I joined AI club as a freshman to learn more about machine learning and other technology, and I have had lots of fun participating in all the different events. I'm also part of the Raider Robotics VEXU team, and I enjoy game development and downhill skiing.
