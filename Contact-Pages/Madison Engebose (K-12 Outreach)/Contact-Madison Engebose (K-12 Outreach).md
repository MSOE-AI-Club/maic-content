Hi! I’m Madison Engebose, and I’m currently a Sophomore Computer Science student at MSOE. I joined AI Club to explore different AI concepts and develop the skills to apply them in real-world scenarios. Outside of AI club, I’m a Software Engineer Intern for Direct Supply and a member of the MSOE Women’s Golf team.
