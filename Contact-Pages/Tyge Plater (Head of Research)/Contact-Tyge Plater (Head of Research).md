### Lead Researcher & Research Coordinator

Hi! My name is Tyge Plater, I am currently a Junior Software Engineering student here at MSOE. I first joined AI club because I wanted to learn about the concepts of AI, and how they can be applied, in combination with software engineering, to solve real world problems â€“ which being on a research team has helped with. In my free time I like to snowboard, longboard, hangout with friends, and play video games.
