### Workshop Developer Strategist

Hi, I’m Reagan Burkemper, a sophomore majoring in Computer Engineering with minors in Data Science and Electrical Engineering. I joined the AI Club out of curiosity and a desire to gain more knowledge and hands-on experience. Outside of AI Club, I play on MSOE’s Women’s Soccer Team and am involved with the High-Powered Rocketry Club. I love being active and spending time outdoors with friends.
