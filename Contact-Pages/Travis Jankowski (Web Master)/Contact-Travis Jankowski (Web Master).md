### Lead Website Developer & Maintainer

Hi, my name is Travis and I am a junior studying computer science. My favorite parts of AI club are the opportunities to apply data science skills to real world problems through hands-on projects. I also serve as the president of Midnight Robotics and I have been a software engineering intern at Cognex for two years.
