### Overall Management of Events & Wider-Community Outreach

Hi! I'm Brett Storoe, and I'm currently a Sophomore Computer Science student. I joined AI Club to explore the latest AI technologies and acquire the skills to apply them. I've learned a lot through AI Club, and I'm excited to see the club continue to grow! Outside of AI Club, I enjoy thrifting and listening to music.
