The thing you index it at is called the key, and the thing the key stores is called the value.\n- The key can be almost any datatype, and the value can be *any* datatype.\n- result['choices'] is an array of dictionaries\n- Use result['choices'][0]['text'] to get the text of the result\n\n**What about chatting?**\n\nOn top of text-completion abilities, we can also do chat-like inputs with the `create_chat_completion` method.\n\n**Developer:** Lucas Gral, Thomas Benzshawel\n\n**Date:** Nov 09, 2023"
